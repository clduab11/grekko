# Grekko Future Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Enhanced Execution (Weeks 3-4)

### 1.1 Multi-DEX Integration
```python
class MultiDexRouter:
    """Route trades through optimal DEX for best execution."""
    
    SUPPORTED_DEXS = {
        'raydium': RaydiumExecutor,
        'orca': OrcaExecutor,
        'jupiter': JupiterAggregator,
        'meteora': MeteoraExecutor
    }
    
    async def find_best_route(self, token_in, token_out, amount):
        # Check prices across all DEXs
        # Account for gas costs
        # Return optimal route
```

### 1.2 Smart Sell System
```python
class ProfitTaker:
    """Automated profit taking with multiple strategies."""
    
    strategies = {
        'trailing_stop': TrailingStopStrategy,
        'target_based': TargetBasedStrategy,
        'momentum_exit': MomentumExitStrategy,
        'time_decay': TimeDecayStrategy
    }
    
    async def monitor_position(self, position):
        # Track price movement
        # Execute sells based on strategy
        # Partial exits for risk management
```

## Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (Weeks 5-8)

### 2.1 ML-Powered Safety Scoring
```python
class MLSafetyAnalyzer:
    """Machine learning model for safety prediction."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self._load_model('models/safety_xgboost.pkl')
        self.feature_extractor = TokenFeatureExtractor()
        
    async def predict_rug_probability(self, token_data):
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract(token_data)
        # Include historical rug pull patterns
        # Social media sentiment
        # On-chain behavior analysis
        return self.model.predict_proba(features)
```

### 2.2 Backtesting Framework
```python
class HistoricalBacktester:
    """Test strategies on historical data."""
    
    async def backtest(self, strategy, start_date, end_date):
        # Replay historical token launches
        # Simulate safety analysis
        # Calculate realistic P&L with slippage
        # Generate performance report
```

## Phase 3: Portfolio Management (Weeks 9-12)

### 3.1 Cross-Chain Expansion
```python
SUPPORTED_CHAINS = {
    'solana': SolanaSniper,
    'ethereum': EthereumSniper,
    'bsc': BSCSniper,
    'base': BaseSniper,
    'arbitrum': ArbitrumSniper
}

class CrossChainManager:
    """Manage sniping across multiple chains."""
    
    async def allocate_capital(self, total_capital):
        # Distribute based on opportunity score
        # Consider gas costs per chain
        # Monitor cross-chain arbitrage
```

### 3.2 Advanced Risk Management
```python
class PortfolioRiskManager:
    """Sophisticated risk management system."""
    
    def calculate_var(self, positions, confidence=0.95):
        # Value at Risk calculation
        # Correlation analysis
        # Stress testing
        
    def optimize_portfolio(self, positions, constraints):
        # Modern Portfolio Theory optimization
        # Risk parity allocation
        # Dynamic hedging strategies
```

## Phase 4: Algorithmic Trading Platform (Months 4-6)

### 4.1 Strategy Marketplace
```python
class StrategyMarketplace:
    """Allow users to create and share strategies."""
    
    features = [
        "Visual strategy builder",
        "Backtesting integration",
        "Performance tracking",
        "Revenue sharing for creators"
    ]
```

### 4.2 Social Trading Features
```python
class SocialTrading:
    """Copy trading and social features."""
    
    features = [
        "Follow top traders",
        "Auto-copy positions",
        "Performance leaderboards",
        "Trading signals marketplace"
    ]
```

## Phase 5: DeFi Integration (Months 7-12)

### 5.1 Yield Optimization
```python
class YieldOptimizer:
    """Optimize idle capital in DeFi."""
    
    async def deploy_idle_funds(self, available_capital):
        # Lend on Solend/Kamino
        # Provide liquidity on concentrated pools
        # Stake in validator pools
        # Auto-compound rewards
```

### 5.2 Flash Loan Strategies
```python
class FlashLoanExecutor:
    """Execute complex strategies with flash loans."""
    
    strategies = [
        "Arbitrage between DEXs",
        "Liquidation hunting",
        "Collateral swapping",
        "Interest rate arbitrage"
    ]
