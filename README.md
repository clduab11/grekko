## Vision

Grekko is a next-generation AI-powered cryptocurrency trading platform built as a multi-agent orchestration system. Moving beyond conventional algorithmic trading, Grekko harnesses the power of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) to form a collaborative intelligence network that analyzes markets, generates trading insights, and executes strategies with precision. Designed for both automated and assisted trading, Grekko bridges the gap between sophisticated institutional trading systems and accessible retail tools.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Agent Orchestration System**: Collaborative network of specialized LLM agents working together
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Advanced AI-powered strategy development and execution
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Choose between fully autonomous trading or assisted decision support

### Comprehensive Market Intelligence
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Real-time data from exchanges, blockchains, and social platforms
- **Advanced Market Analysis**: Sophisticated pattern recognition and market regime classification
- **Sentiment & On-Chain Intelligence**: Social signal processing and blockchain analytics

### Robust Trading Capabilities
- **Multi-Exchange Integration**: Seamless trading on major CEX and DEX platforms
- **Smart Order Routing**: Optimized execution across venues for best pricing
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive position sizing, circuit breakers, and drawdown protection

### Enterprise-Grade Security
- **Secure Credential Management**: Military-grade encryption for API keys and private keys
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance tracking
- **Configurable Safety Guardrails**: Fine-grained control over autonomous trading boundaries

## Agent Orchestration

Grekko's core innovation is its Multi-Agent Orchestration System. Unlike single-model trading systems, Grekko distributes tasks across specialized agents:

- **Market Analyst Agent**: Technical analysis and trend identification
- **Risk Assessment Agent**: Portfolio risk evaluation and position sizing
- **Strategy Optimization Agent**: Performance analysis and parameter tuning
- **Execution Planning Agent**: Order routing and execution timing
- **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Social media and news sentiment tracking
- **Portfolio Management Agent**: Asset allocation and rebalancing

These agents collaborate under a master orchestrator, combining their specialized insights to form a unified trading intelligence.

## Dual-Mode Operation

### Grekko Mode
Interactive trade assistance providing insights and recommendations while keeping the human in control:
- Strategy recommendations with detailed rationale
- Risk assessment for potential trades
- Performance analytics and portfolio insights
- Learning from your trading preferences

### Gordon Gekko Mode
Fully autonomous trading with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for independent operation:
- Autonomous market analysis and trading decisions
- Real-time execution on configured exchanges
- Self-adjusting strategies based on market conditions
- Comprehensive audit logs and performance reporting

## Paper Trading System

Test strategies with real market data but zero financial risk:

- **Realistic Simulation**: Accurate modeling of market conditions, slippage, and fees
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Detailed performance metrics and risk analysis
- **Transition Planning**: Data-driven evaluation of readiness for live trading
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of paper trading performance
