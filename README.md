## Vision

Grekko is an ambitious AI-powered cryptocurrency trading platform designed as a semi-autonomous LLM-backed trading agent. Unlike conventional trading bots or signal providers, Grekko aims to function as an independent agent capable of making trading decisions and executing them with minimal human intervention. By integrating advanced AI technologies with technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and on-chain intelligence, Grekko strives to identify profitable trading opportunities across both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

## Current Development Status

Grekko is currently in **early alpha development** with a skeleton codebase that provides architectural structure but requires significant implementation work. The foundation has been laid with a modular architecture, but many components are placeholder files awaiting implementation.

### Implemented Components
- Project structure and modular architecture
- Requirements specification
- Development roadmap and planning documents
- Basic Docker configuration
- Initial security planning (credential vault concept)

### Under Development
- Secure credential management system
- Exchange connectors for CEX and DEX integration
- LLM-powered autonomous trading agent
- Risk management system
- Trading strategy implementations

## Architecture

Grekko follows a modular architecture with these core components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Connectors for exchanges, blockchain data, and social media
- **Market Analysis**: Tools for market regime classification and trend detection
- **Alpha Generation**: Social sentiment analysis and on-chain intelligence
- **Strategy**: Implementation of various trading strategies
- **Execution**: Order execution on both CEX and DEX platforms
- **Risk Management**: Position monitoring and risk controls
- **AI Adaptation**: ML models and reinforcement learning for adaptive strategies

## Planned Features

- **Autonomous Trading**: LLM-powered decision-making with configurable risk parameters
- **Multi-Exchange Integration**: Real-time connectivity to CEXs (Coinbase, Binance) & DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap)
- **Meme Coin Support**: Trading capabilities via direct DEX router contracts
- **Secure Key Management**: Military-grade encryption for API keys and private keys
- **Mobile Companion App**: React Native app for monitoring and configuration
- **Risk Management**: Configurable risk parameters, circuit breakers, and position sizing
- **Advanced Technical Analysis**: Integration with TradingView and custom indicators
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Social media and news monitoring for market sentiment
- **On-Chain Intelligence**: Whale tracking and smart money flow analysis

## Security Protocols

- **Zero Hardcoded Credentials**: All credentials stored in an encrypted vault
- **TLS 1.3**: Secure communications with exchanges
- **HSM-like Key Storage**: Using libsodium sealed boxes
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Secret scanning to prevent credential leaks

## Getting Started

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Grekko is in early development and not yet ready for production use. The following instructions are for development purposes only.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/clduab11/grekko.git
   cd grekko
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Docker (optional):
   ```sh
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

### Configuration

1. Set up credentials storage:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.grekko
   ```

2. Create a .env file with required configuration (template will be provided in future updates)
