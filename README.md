## Vision

Grekko is an ambitious AI-powered cryptocurrency trading platform designed as a semi-autonomous LLM-backed trading agent. Unlike conventional trading bots or signal providers, Grekko aims to function as an independent agent capable of making trading decisions and executing them with minimal human intervention. By integrating advanced AI technologies with technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and on-chain intelligence, Grekko strives to identify profitable trading opportunities across both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

## Current Development Status

Grekko has progressed to **alpha development** with significant implementation work completed. The project now has functional core components and is approaching a minimally viable trading system with sophisticated AI capabilities.

### Implemented Components
- Complete modular architecture
- Secure credential management system with encryption
- Docker-based deployment infrastructure for development, testing, and production
- LLM-powered autonomous trading agent with configurable parameters
- Multi-model LLM ensemble architecture for advanced decision making
- Risk management system with position sizing and circuit breakers
- Functional exchange connectors for CEX and DEX integration
- Trading strategy implementations including technical, sentiment, and hybrid approaches

### Under Development
- Mobile companion app for monitoring and control
- Advanced backtesting capabilities
- Additional exchange integrations
- Expanded on-chain intelligence features

## Architecture

Grekko follows a modular architecture with these core components:

- **Data Ingestion**: Connectors for exchanges, blockchain data, and social media with real-time streaming
- **Market Analysis**: Advanced tools for market regime classification and trend detection
- **Alpha Generation**: Social sentiment analysis and on-chain intelligence from multiple sources
- **Strategy**: Implementation of various trading strategies coordinated by LLM ensemble
- **Execution**: Order execution on both CEX and DEX platforms with latency optimization
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive position monitoring, risk controls, and circuit breakers
- **AI Adaptation**: LLM ensemble architecture with specialized models and reinforcement learning for adaptive strategies

## Planned Features

- **Advanced Autonomous Trading**: Multi-model LLM ensemble for sophisticated market analysis and trading decisions
- **Multi-Exchange Integration**: Real-time connectivity to CEXs (Coinbase, Binance) & DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap) with order routing
- **Meme Coin Support**: Trading capabilities via direct DEX router contracts with gas optimization
- **Secure Key Management**: Military-grade encryption for API keys and private keys with credential rotation
- **Mobile Companion App**: React Native app for monitoring, configuration, and trade alerts
- **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Configurable risk parameters, circuit breakers, position sizing, and drawdown protection
- **Advanced Technical Analysis**: Integration with TradingView and custom indicators with pattern recognition
- **Multi-Source Sentiment Analysis**: Social media, news, and forum monitoring for market sentiment with ML-based scoring
- **Enhanced On-Chain Intelligence**: Whale tracking, smart money flow analysis, and mempool monitoring

## Security Protocols

- **Secured Credential Management**: All credentials stored in an encrypted vault with secure memory handling
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption**: Secure communications with exchanges and API endpoints
- **HSM-like Key Storage**: Using libsodium sealed boxes with credential rotation capabilities
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Secret scanning to prevent credential leaks
- **Access Controls**: IP-based restrictions for administrative functions
- **Regular Security Audits**: Automated vulnerability scanning

## Getting Started

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Grekko is in early development and not yet ready for production use. The following instructions are for development purposes only.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/clduab11/grekko.git
   cd grekko
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up credential storage:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.grekko
   python scripts/setup.py --init-vault
   ```

4. Start with Docker:
   ```sh
   # For development
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   
   # For testing
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up -d
   
   # For production
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the trading agent:
   ```sh
   cp config/agent_config.yaml.example config/agent_config.yaml
   # Edit the file to set your desired parameters
   ```

2. Add exchange API credentials:
   ```sh
   python scripts/setup.py --add-credential binance --key YOUR_API_KEY --secret YOUR_API_SECRET
   ```

3. Set environment variables in a .env file:
   ```
   CONFIG_ENV=development
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
