# Autonomous Cryptocurrency Trading System Specification

## 1. Project Context

### 1.1 Project Goals
- Develop an autonomous cryptocurrency trading system for the Grekko platform.
- Enable low-latency trading through Coinbase API integration.
- Incorporate Metamask for wallet functionality and decentralized interactions.
- Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) for autonomous trading operations.
- Support mode-dependent trading capabilities for Grekko agents.
- Ensure compliance with SPARC principles: modularity, security, error handling, and testability.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Crypto traders seeking automated, data-driven trading solutions.
- Grekko platform administrators managing autonomous agents.

### 1.3 Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Grekko architecture (`src/execution/`, `src/data_ingestion/connectors/`).
- Requires low-latency operations for real-time trading.
- Must support multi-agent coordination for decision-making.

### 1.4 Integration Points
- Coinbase API for centralized exchange operations.
- Metamask for wallet management and decentralized execution.
- MCP tools (via Playwright or Puppeteer) for browser-based automation.
- Tavily MCP for research and tool identification.
- Existing Grekko modules for data ingestion, risk management, and strategy execution.

### 1.5 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second latency for trade execution.
- **Security**: Robust credential management with no hard-coded secrets.
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple simultaneous trading operations.
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 1.6 Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope**: API integrations, autonomous trading logic, multi-agent protocols, risk controls.
- **Out of Scope**: User interface development beyond API exposure for frontend.

### 1.7 Stakeholders
- Grekko development team.
- End-users of the trading platform.
- Regulatory bodies for compliance considerations.

### 1.8 Existing Systems
- Leverage Grekko's data ingestion connectors (`src/data_ingestion/connectors/`).
- Utilize existing execution modules (`src/execution/`) for trade routing.

### 1.9 Regulatory Requirements
- Adherence to KYC/AML regulations for trading activities.
- Compliance with regional cryptocurrency trading laws.

### 1.10 Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: API rate limiting impacting trade execution.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and request optimization.
- **Risk**: Security breaches in credential management.
  - **Mitigation**: Use environment variables and encryption.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Coinbase API Integration
- Enable autonomous purchases and sales with low latency.
- Support account management, order placement, and transaction history retrieval.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System must execute a trade within 1 second of decision.
  - Must handle API rate limits and errors gracefully.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

### 2.2 Metamask Functionality Integration
- Facilitate wallet operations for decentralized trading.
- Support transaction signing and interaction with dApps.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Successful connection and transaction signing with Metamask.
  - Error handling for connection failures or user rejections.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

### 2.3 MCP Implementation
- Support autonomous trading through Playwright or Puppeteer MCP tools.
- Enable browser-based automation for trading operations.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System must interact with web interfaces for trading without human intervention.
  - Must log automation steps for debugging.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

### 2.4 Mode-Dependent Autonomous Trading
- Enable Grekko agents to adapt trading strategies based on operational mode (e.g., aggressive, conservative).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agents must switch trading logic based on mode configuration.
  - Mode changes must not disrupt ongoing trades.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

### 2.5 Tavily MCP Research
- Use Tavily MCP to identify and integrate necessary MCP tools for trading.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System must document researched tools and integration feasibility.
  - Must update toolset based on research findings.
- **Priority**: Should-have.

### 2.6 Multi-Agent Coordination Protocols
- Define communication and decision-making protocols for multiple agents.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agents must reach consensus on trade decisions without conflicts.
  - Must log coordination events for audit.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

### 2.7 Risk Management and Safety Controls
- Implement stop-loss, circuit breakers, and exposure limits.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System must halt trading if risk thresholds are breached.
  - Must notify administrators of risk events.
- **Priority**: Must-have.

## 3. Edge Cases
- API downtime or rate limiting during critical trading windows.
- Metamask connection failures or user permission denials.
- Conflicting agent decisions in multi-agent scenarios.
- Regulatory changes impacting trading permissions.

## 4. Security Considerations
- Credential management via environment variables and encryption.
- Secure API authentication flows with OAuth or API keys.
- Anonymity measures for transaction privacy where applicable.

## 5. Performance Requirements
- Trade execution latency under 1 second.
- System must handle 100+ concurrent trading operations.
- API request optimization to avoid rate limiting.

## 6. Compliance and Regulatory Considerations
- Implement KYC/AML checks for user onboarding.
- Log all transactions for audit purposes.
- Adapt to regional restrictions on cryptocurrency trading.
