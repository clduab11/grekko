# Grekko Trading System - Post-Deployment Monitoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring strategy for the Grekko Trading System, covering system health, trading performance, risk metrics, and infrastructure monitoring.

## Current Status

**Cluster Status**: No production cluster currently deployed
**Monitoring Phase**: Pre-deployment planning and local development monitoring

## Monitoring Architecture

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring

#### Kubernetes Cluster Metrics
- **Node Health**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Pod Status**: Running, pending, failed, restart counts
- **Resource Usage**: Requests vs limits, resource quotas
- **Network**: Service mesh metrics, ingress/egress traffic

#### Database Monitoring
- **PostgreSQL**: Query performance, connection pools, lock contention
- **Redis**: Memory usage, hit/miss ratios, connection counts
- **InfluxDB**: Write/query performance, storage utilization

#### Message Bus Monitoring
- **Kafka**: Topic lag, partition distribution, broker health
- **Message Throughput**: Producer/consumer rates, error rates

### 2. Application Monitoring

#### Trading Services
- **Coinbase Integration**: API response times, rate limits, order success rates
- **MetaMask Integration**: Transaction success rates, gas usage, wallet connectivity
- **Risk Management**: Circuit breaker triggers, compliance violations, exposure calculations
- **Agent Coordination**: Consensus latency, task distribution, event processing

#### Performance Metrics (RED Method)
- **Rate**: Requests per second for each service
- **Errors**: Error rates and types by service
- **Duration**: Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)

### 3. Business Metrics

#### Trading Performance
- **Order Execution**: Latency, success rates, slippage
- **Portfolio Performance**: P&L tracking, position sizes, exposure
- **Risk Metrics**: VaR, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- **Compliance**: Regulatory adherence, audit trail completeness

#### System Reliability
- **Uptime**: Service availability (target: 99.9%)
- **Data Integrity**: Transaction consistency, backup verification
- **Security**: Authentication failures, suspicious activity detection

## Monitoring Tools Stack

### Core Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing

### Log Management
- **Fluentd**: Log collection and forwarding
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and indexing
- **Kibana**: Log analysis and visualization

### Application Performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs
- **Health Checks**: Service readiness and liveness probes
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: End-to-end transaction testing

## Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response Required)
- Service down (any core trading service)
- Database connection failures
- Risk limit breaches
- Security incidents
- Data loss or corruption

### Warning Alerts (Attention Needed Soon)
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>100ms P95)
- Resource utilization >80%
- Approaching rate limits

### Info Alerts (Noteworthy Events)
- Deployments
- Configuration changes
- Scheduled maintenance
- Performance threshold changes

## SLA/SLO Definitions

### Service Level Objectives
- **API Response Time**: <100ms P95
- **Order Execution**: <50ms average latency
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Data Freshness**: <1 second for market data
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes for service restart

### Service Level Indicators
- HTTP response codes and latencies
- Database query performance
- Message processing rates
- Error rates by service and endpoint

## Monitoring Dashboards

### Executive Dashboard
- Overall system health
- Trading performance summary
- Risk metrics overview
- Revenue and P&L tracking

### Operations Dashboard
- Service status and health
- Resource utilization
- Error rates and alerts
- Performance trends

### Development Dashboard
- Application metrics
- Deployment status
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage and results

### Trading Dashboard
- Real-time market data
- Order book status
- Position monitoring
- Risk exposure tracking

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Local Development Monitoring
- Set up basic logging
- Implement health checks
- Create development dashboards
- Establish baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Staging Environment
- Deploy monitoring stack
- Configure alerts
- Test monitoring coverage
- Validate alert thresholds

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- Full monitoring implementation
- 24/7 alert coverage
- Performance optimization
- Continuous improvement

## Monitoring Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure deployed
- [ ] Dashboards configured
- [ ] Alert rules defined
- [ ] Runbooks created
- [ ] On-call procedures established

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Baseline metrics established
- [ ] Alert thresholds validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks set
- [ ] Monitoring coverage verified
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Troubleshooting Runbooks

### Service Down
1. Check service status in Kubernetes
2. Review recent deployments
3. Check resource availability
4. Examine error logs
5. Escalate if needed

### High Error Rates
1. Identify error patterns
2. Check upstream dependencies
3. Review recent changes
4. Implement circuit breakers
5. Scale if necessary

### Performance Degradation
1. Check resource utilization
2. Analyze slow queries
3. Review traffic patterns
4. Optimize bottlenecks
5. Scale horizontally if needed

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly performance reviews
- Monthly SLA assessments
- Quarterly monitoring strategy updates
- Annual architecture reviews

### Optimization Areas
- Alert noise reduction
- Dashboard effectiveness
- Monitoring overhead
- Cost optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up local development monitoring
2. **Short-term**: Prepare monitoring infrastructure for deployment
3. **Medium-term**: Deploy to staging environment
4. **Long-term**: Full production monitoring implementation
