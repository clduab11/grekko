## Overview

The decentralized execution architecture enables Grekko to execute trades across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and blockchain networks while maintaining privacy, security, and efficiency. This system utilizes smart contracts, non-custodial wallets, and advanced transaction routing to execute trades with minimal slippage and maximal privacy.

### Core Principles

1. **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain control of their private keys at all times
2. **Privacy-Focused**: Transactions are executed with techniques to enhance privacy
3. **Network Agnostic**: Support for multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
4. **MEV-Resistant**: Protection against front-running and sandwich attacks
5. **Gas-Optimized**: Minimize transaction costs through batching and gas optimization
6. **Failover Support**: Robust fallback mechanisms for high reliability

## Architecture

The decentralized execution architecture follows a layered design with these key components:
