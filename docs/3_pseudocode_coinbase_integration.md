# Pseudocode Design: Coinbase API Integration for Autonomous Trading

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for integrating Coinbase API into the Grekko autonomous trading system. The focus is on enabling low-latency trade execution with robust error handling and testability.

## 2. Module Purpose
- Facilitate autonomous trade operations (buy/sell) via Coinbase API.
- Manage authentication and connection status.
- Optimize for low-latency performance.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Initialize Coinbase Connection
- **Preconditions**: System configuration loaded with API credentials from secure storage.
- **Steps**:
  1. Retrieve API credentials from environment variables.
  2. Establish connection to Coinbase API endpoint.
  3. Validate connection by requesting account status.
  4. Set ConnectionStatus to 'authenticated' on success or 'failed' on error.
- **Postconditions**: Connection established or error logged for retry.
- **Error Handling**: If connection fails, log error details and trigger retry mechanism after delay.
- **Performance Note**: Connection initialization must complete within 500ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Successful connection with valid credentials returns 'authenticated' status.
  - // TEST: Invalid credentials result in 'failed' status and logged error.
  - // TEST: Connection timeout triggers retry mechanism.

### 3.2 Monitor Connection Health
- **Preconditions**: Coinbase connection initialized.
- **Steps**:
  1. Periodically ping Coinbase API to check latency and status.
  2. Update Latency metric with response time.
  3. If ping fails, mark ConnectionStatus as 'expired' and initiate re-authentication.
  4. Log health status changes for monitoring.
- **Postconditions**: Connection health metrics updated; re-authentication triggered if needed.
- **Error Handling**: On repeated failures, escalate to emergency stop of trading operations.
- **Performance Note**: Health checks must not exceed 100ms to avoid impacting trade latency.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Health check updates Latency metric on successful ping.
  - // TEST: Failed ping sets ConnectionStatus to 'expired' and triggers re-authentication.
  - // TEST: Repeated failures escalate to emergency stop.

### 3.3 Execute Trade Order
- **Preconditions**: Valid TradeOrder created by TradingAgent; Coinbase connection authenticated.
- **Steps**:
  1. Validate TradeOrder parameters (Asset, Quantity, Price, Type).
  2. Format order request according to Coinbase API specifications.
  3. Submit order request to Coinbase API.
  4. Record submission timestamp for latency tracking.
  5. Await response and update TradeOrder Status (executed, failed).
  6. Log execution details including fees and actual price.
- **Postconditions**: TradeOrder status updated; execution logged.
- **Error Handling**: If submission fails, retry once after validating connection; if retry fails, mark order as failed and notify agent.
- **Performance Note**: Order execution must complete within 1 second to meet latency requirements.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Valid TradeOrder parameters result in successful API submission.
  - // TEST: Invalid parameters prevent submission and log error.
  - // TEST: API failure triggers retry; second failure marks order as failed.
  - // TEST: Execution latency tracked and logged for optimization.

### 3.4 Handle Rate Limiting
- **Preconditions**: Coinbase API request in progress or planned.
- **Steps**:
  1. Check current request count against API rate limits.
  2. If nearing limit, queue non-critical requests (e.g., health checks) for later.
  3. For critical trade requests, prioritize and execute immediately if within limit.
  4. If limit exceeded, delay request and log warning.
- **Postconditions**: Requests managed within rate limits; critical trades prioritized.
- **Error Handling**: If trade request delayed too long, notify agent for alternative routing.
- **Performance Note**: Rate limit checks must add less than 10ms overhead.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Rate limit nearing triggers queuing of non-critical requests.
  - // TEST: Critical trade requests execute within limit constraints.
  - // TEST: Exceeded limit delays request and logs warning.

## 4. Input Validation
- **API Credentials**: Must be non-empty strings, retrieved securely.
- **TradeOrder Parameters**: Asset must be supported by Coinbase; Quantity and Price must be positive; Type must be a valid enum.
- **Latency Metrics**: Must be positive numbers or zero.

## 5. Integration Points
- Connects to Grekko's `src/data_ingestion/connectors/exchange_connectors/coinbase_connector.py` for data retrieval.
- Interfaces with `src/execution/cex/coinbase_executor.py` for order routing.
- Logs to central monitoring system for latency and error tracking.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- ConnectionStatus updates reflecting authentication state.
- TradeOrder Status updates post-execution.
- Detailed logs of API interactions and errors for audit.
