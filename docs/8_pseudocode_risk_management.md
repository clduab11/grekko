# Pseudocode Design: Risk Management and Safety Controls for Autonomous Trading

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for implementing risk management and safety controls in the Grekko autonomous trading system. The focus is on protecting the system with stop-loss mechanisms, circuit breakers, and exposure limits.

## 2. Module Purpose
- Implement stop-loss to limit losses on individual trades.
- Enforce circuit breakers to halt trading during extreme conditions.
- Monitor and control exposure to prevent over-leveraging.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Initialize Risk Parameters
- **Preconditions**: System configuration loaded with risk management settings.
- **Steps**:
  1. Retrieve risk parameters (StopLossThreshold, MaxExposure, CircuitBreakerThreshold) from configuration.
  2. Validate parameters against acceptable ranges (e.g., StopLossThreshold as percentage).
  3. Assign validated parameters to RiskManager for monitoring.
  4. Log initialization of risk parameters for audit.
- **Postconditions**: Risk parameters set and ready for monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: If parameters invalid or missing, use conservative defaults and log warning.
- **Performance Note**: Initialization must complete within 100ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Risk parameters loaded and validated from configuration.
  - // TEST: Invalid parameters trigger conservative defaults with warning.
  - // TEST: Initialization logged for audit purposes.

### 3.2 Monitor Stop-Loss for Active Trades
- **Preconditions**: Active TradeOrders exist; risk parameters initialized.
- **Steps**:
  1. For each active TradeOrder, track current market price against entry price.
  2. Calculate loss percentage if position is underwater.
  3. If loss exceeds StopLossThreshold, trigger automatic sell order.
  4. Update TradeOrder.Status to 'closed' and log stop-loss event.
- **Postconditions**: Trade closed if stop-loss triggered; status updated.
- **Error Handling**: If market data unavailable, assume worst-case and trigger stop-loss; log error.
- **Performance Note**: Monitoring cycle must complete within 200ms per trade.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Loss exceeding StopLossThreshold triggers automatic sell order.
  - // TEST: TradeOrder.Status updated to 'closed' post stop-loss.
  - // TEST: Unavailable market data assumes worst-case and triggers stop-loss.

### 3.3 Enforce Circuit Breaker During Market Extremes
- **Preconditions**: Risk parameters initialized; market data streaming.
- **Steps**:
  1. Monitor market volatility or price drop against CircuitBreakerThreshold.
  2. If threshold breached (e.g., rapid 10% market drop), halt all trading operations.
  3. Notify administrators of circuit breaker activation with market data snapshot.
  4. Await manual or timed reset to resume trading; log event.
- **Postconditions**: Trading halted during extreme conditions; admins notified.
- **Error Handling**: If market data feed fails, activate circuit breaker as precaution and log error.
- **Performance Note**: Detection and activation must occur within 500ms of threshold breach.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Volatility or price drop breaching threshold halts trading.
  - // TEST: Admin notification sent with market data snapshot.
  - // TEST: Data feed failure activates circuit breaker as precaution.

### 3.4 Control Exposure Limits
- **Preconditions**: Risk parameters initialized; active trades or positions exist.
- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate total exposure across all active TradeOrders and Wallet holdings.
  2. Compare total exposure against MaxExposure limit.
  3. If limit approached (e.g., 90% of MaxExposure), restrict new buy orders.
  4. If limit exceeded, trigger reduction actions (e.g., partial sell orders) and log event.
- **Postconditions**: Exposure maintained within safe limits; actions logged.
- **Error Handling**: If exposure calculation fails, assume maximum exposure and restrict trades; log error.
- **Performance Note**: Exposure check must complete within 300ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Exposure nearing MaxExposure restricts new buy orders.
  - // TEST: Exposure exceeding limit triggers reduction actions.
  - // TEST: Calculation failure assumes max exposure and restricts trades.

## 4. Input Validation
- **Risk Parameters**: StopLossThreshold and CircuitBreakerThreshold must be valid percentages; MaxExposure must be a positive value.
- **Market Data**: Must be current and validated before use in risk calculations.
- **TradeOrder Data**: Must include entry price and current status for stop-loss monitoring.

## 5. Integration Points
- Interfaces with Grekko's `src/risk_management/risk_manager.py` for risk calculations.
- Connects to `src/risk_management/stop_loss_manager.py` for stop-loss execution.
- Logs risk events and safety actions to central monitoring system.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- RiskManager parameters reflecting configured safety limits.
- TradeOrder.Status updates when stop-loss or exposure actions are triggered.
- Circuit breaker status indicating trading halt or resumption.
- Logs of risk events and safety interventions for audit.
