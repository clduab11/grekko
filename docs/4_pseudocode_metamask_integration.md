# Pseudocode Design: Metamask Integration for Autonomous Trading

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for integrating Metamask functionality into the Grekko autonomous trading system. The focus is on enabling wallet operations and decentralized trading interactions with robust error handling.

## 2. Module Purpose
- Facilitate connection to Metamask for wallet management.
- Enable transaction signing for decentralized trading.
- Ensure secure and reliable interactions with blockchain networks.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Initialize Metamask Connection
- **Preconditions**: System configuration loaded with wallet provider details.
- **Steps**:
  1. Detect Metamask provider availability in the environment.
  2. Request user permission to connect to Metamask if not already connected.
  3. Retrieve wallet address and connection status on successful connection.
  4. Set Wallet.ConnectionStatus to 'connected' on success or 'disconnected' on failure.
- **Postconditions**: Wallet connection established or error state recorded.
- **Error Handling**: If connection fails, log error and prompt for retry or alternative provider.
- **Performance Note**: Connection initialization must complete within 2 seconds.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Metamask provider detected and connection request initiated.
  - // TEST: Successful connection updates Wallet.ConnectionStatus to 'connected'.
  - // TEST: Connection failure or user rejection sets status to 'disconnected'.

### 3.2 Retrieve Wallet Balance
- **Preconditions**: Metamask connection established.
- **Steps**:
  1. Query blockchain network for current balance of connected wallet address.
  2. Update Wallet.Balance with asset-specific holdings.
  3. Log balance retrieval for monitoring and audit purposes.
- **Postconditions**: Wallet balance updated and available for trading decisions.
- **Error Handling**: On query failure, retry once; if persistent, mark balance as unavailable and notify system.
- **Performance Note**: Balance retrieval must complete within 1 second.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Balance query returns current holdings for connected wallet.
  - // TEST: Query failure triggers retry; persistent failure logs error.
  - // TEST: Balance update reflected in Wallet entity.

### 3.3 Sign and Execute Decentralized Trade
- **Preconditions**: Valid TradeOrder created; Metamask connected; sufficient balance.
- **Steps**:
  1. Validate TradeOrder parameters against Wallet.Balance.
  2. Prepare transaction payload for decentralized exchange (DEX) interaction.
  3. Request Metamask to sign the transaction payload.
  4. Submit signed transaction to blockchain network.
  5. Monitor transaction status (pending, confirmed, failed).
  6. Update TradeOrder.Status based on transaction outcome.
- **Postconditions**: Trade executed on blockchain; status updated.
- **Error Handling**: If signing rejected by user, mark order as failed; if transaction fails, log error and retry if gas-related.
- **Performance Note**: Transaction signing and submission must aim for sub-second latency.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Valid TradeOrder with sufficient balance proceeds to signing.
  - // TEST: User rejection of signing marks order as failed.
  - // TEST: Transaction submission failure due to gas logs error and retries.
  - // TEST: Successful transaction updates TradeOrder.Status to 'executed'.

### 3.4 Handle Network Switching
- **Preconditions**: Metamask connected; trading operation requires specific blockchain network.
- **Steps**:
  1. Check current network of connected Metamask wallet.
  2. If network mismatch, request switch to target network.
  3. Await user confirmation or automatic switch completion.
  4. Validate new network status post-switch.
- **Postconditions**: Wallet connected to correct network for trading.
- **Error Handling**: If switch fails or user denies, log error and halt related trades.
- **Performance Note**: Network switch request must complete within 3 seconds.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Current network mismatch triggers switch request.
  - // TEST: Successful switch updates wallet network status.
  - // TEST: User denial or failure halts related trade operations.

## 4. Input Validation
- **Wallet Address**: Must conform to blockchain address format.
- **TradeOrder Parameters**: Must match available balance and supported assets on target network.
- **Network ID**: Must be a supported blockchain network for trading.

## 5. Integration Points
- Interfaces with Grekko's `src/execution/decentralized_execution/wallet_manager.py` for wallet operations.
- Connects to `src/execution/dex/uniswap_executor.py` for DEX interactions.
- Logs to central system for transaction and error tracking.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- Wallet.ConnectionStatus reflecting connection state.
- Wallet.Balance updated with current holdings.
- TradeOrder.Status updates post-transaction execution.
- Detailed logs of blockchain interactions for audit.
