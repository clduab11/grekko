# Pseudocode Design: Mode-Dependent Autonomous Trading for Grekko Agent

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for implementing mode-dependent autonomous trading capabilities in the Grekko system. The focus is on enabling agents to adapt trading strategies based on operational modes (e.g., aggressive, conservative).

## 2. Module Purpose
- Allow TradingAgents to switch trading behavior based on configured mode.
- Ensure seamless transitions without disrupting ongoing trades.
- Support dynamic adaptation to market conditions or user preferences.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Load Agent Mode Configuration
- **Preconditions**: TradingAgent initialized with access to configuration data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Retrieve mode configuration (e.g., aggressive, conservative) from AgentConfiguration.
  2. Load associated parameters (RiskTolerance, TradeFrequency, PreferredAssets).
  3. Validate parameters against acceptable ranges and rules.
  4. Set TradingAgent.Mode to the loaded configuration.
- **Postconditions**: Agent mode and parameters set for trading decisions.
- **Error Handling**: If configuration invalid or missing, default to conservative mode and log warning.
- **Performance Note**: Configuration loading must complete within 100ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Valid mode configuration loaded sets TradingAgent.Mode correctly.
  - // TEST: Invalid configuration defaults to conservative mode with warning.
  - // TEST: Parameters validated within acceptable ranges.

### 3.2 Adapt Trading Strategy to Mode
- **Preconditions**: Agent mode configuration loaded.
- **Steps**:
  1. Select trading strategy logic based on TradingAgent.Mode.
  2. Adjust decision parameters (e.g., risk thresholds, position sizing) to match mode.
  3. Prioritize assets or trade types as per mode-specific PreferredAssets or rules.
  4. Log strategy adaptation for audit and monitoring.
- **Postconditions**: Trading strategy aligned with current mode.
- **Error Handling**: If strategy adaptation fails, revert to default strategy and log error.
- **Performance Note**: Strategy adaptation must complete within 200ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Aggressive mode increases risk thresholds and trade frequency.
  - // TEST: Conservative mode reduces risk thresholds and prioritizes stability.
  - // TEST: Adaptation failure reverts to default strategy with logged error.

### 3.3 Handle Mode Switching
- **Preconditions**: TradingAgent active; mode change triggered by user or market condition.
- **Steps**:
  1. Receive mode switch request with new mode identifier.
  2. Validate new mode against supported modes.
  3. Pause new trade decisions while maintaining ongoing trades.
  4. Update TradingAgent.Mode and reload associated parameters.
  5. Resume trading with new strategy logic.
  6. Log mode switch event with rationale (user request or market trigger).
- **Postconditions**: Agent operates under new mode without disrupting ongoing trades.
- **Error Handling**: If mode switch fails or is invalid, maintain current mode and log error.
- **Performance Note**: Mode switch must complete within 500ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Valid mode switch request updates TradingAgent.Mode and parameters.
  - // TEST: Ongoing trades unaffected during mode switch.
  - // TEST: Invalid mode switch maintains current mode with logged error.

### 3.4 Monitor Market Conditions for Mode Triggers
- **Preconditions**: TradingAgent active with mode-dependent capabilities enabled.
- **Steps**:
  1. Continuously evaluate market data (volatility, volume, sentiment) against mode trigger thresholds.
  2. If trigger condition met (e.g., high volatility for aggressive mode), propose mode switch.
  3. Await confirmation (automatic or user) for mode switch.
  4. Execute mode switch if confirmed, log decision rationale.
- **Postconditions**: Mode adapted to market conditions when triggers are met.
- **Error Handling**: If market data unavailable, maintain current mode and log warning.
- **Performance Note**: Market monitoring must not exceed 100ms per cycle.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: High volatility triggers proposal for aggressive mode switch.
  - // TEST: Confirmation executes mode switch with logged rationale.
  - // TEST: Unavailable market data maintains current mode with warning.

## 4. Input Validation
- **Mode Identifier**: Must be a supported enum value (aggressive, conservative, balanced).
- **Parameters**: RiskTolerance must be between 0.0 and 1.0; TradeFrequency must be positive.
- **Market Triggers**: Thresholds for mode switching must be predefined and validated.

## 5. Integration Points
- Interfaces with Grekko's `src/ai_adaptation/agent/trading_agent.py` for agent behavior.
- Connects to `src/market_analysis/market_regime/phase_classifier.py` for market condition data.
- Logs mode changes and strategy adaptations to central monitoring system.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- TradingAgent.Mode reflecting current operational mode.
- Strategy parameters adjusted to match mode-specific logic.
- Logs of mode switches and market trigger events for audit.
