# Pseudocode Design: MCP Implementation for Autonomous Trading

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for implementing MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools in the Grekko autonomous trading system. The focus is on enabling browser-based automation for trading operations using tools like Playwright or Puppeteer.

## 2. Module Purpose
- Facilitate autonomous interaction with web interfaces for trading.
- Integrate MCP tools for research and operational automation.
- Ensure reliable and logged automation processes.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Initialize MCP Tool Environment
- **Preconditions**: System configuration loaded with MCP tool specifications.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify required MCP tool (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer) from configuration.
  2. Set up tool environment with necessary dependencies.
  3. Test tool initialization with a simple web interaction.
  4. Set MCPTool.IntegrationStatus to 'active' on success or 'inactive' on failure.
- **Postconditions**: MCP tool environment ready for automation tasks.
- **Error Handling**: If initialization fails, log error details and attempt fallback to alternative tool.
- **Performance Note**: Initialization must complete within 5 seconds.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Correct MCP tool identified and initialized from configuration.
  - // TEST: Successful initialization sets IntegrationStatus to 'active'.
  - // TEST: Initialization failure logs error and triggers fallback.

### 3.2 Configure Automation Workflow
- **Preconditions**: MCP tool environment initialized.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load target web interface URL and interaction script from configuration.
  2. Define automation steps (e.g., login, navigate to trade page, input order details).
  3. Validate workflow steps against expected web interface structure.
  4. Store validated workflow for execution.
- **Postconditions**: Automation workflow configured and ready for execution.
- **Error Handling**: If validation fails due to interface mismatch, log error and notify for script update.
- **Performance Note**: Workflow configuration must complete within 2 seconds.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Workflow steps loaded and validated against target interface.
  - // TEST: Validation failure due to mismatch logs error for script update.
  - // TEST: Valid workflow stored for execution.

### 3.3 Execute Automated Trading Operation
- **Preconditions**: Automation workflow configured; TradeOrder ready for execution.
- **Steps**:
  1. Launch browser instance using MCP tool.
  2. Execute defined workflow steps to input TradeOrder details on web interface.
  3. Monitor execution for completion or interruption.
  4. Capture result (success, partial completion, failure) and update TradeOrder.Status.
  5. Log detailed steps and outcomes for debugging.
- **Postconditions**: Trade operation attempted via web interface; status updated.
- **Error Handling**: If execution fails, retry once with fresh browser instance; if retry fails, mark operation as failed.
- **Performance Note**: Execution must aim for completion within 10 seconds per operation.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Browser instance launches and executes workflow steps.
  - // TEST: Successful execution updates TradeOrder.Status to 'executed'.
  - // TEST: Execution failure triggers retry; second failure marks as 'failed'.
  - // TEST: Detailed logs captured for each step and outcome.

### 3.4 Handle Web Interface Changes
- **Preconditions**: Automated operation in progress or scheduled.
- **Steps**:
  1. Detect changes in web interface structure during execution (e.g., element not found).
  2. Pause operation and log detected change.
  3. Attempt to adapt workflow by re-validating steps against new structure.
  4. If adaptation successful, resume operation; otherwise, halt and notify for manual update.
- **Postconditions**: Operation adapted to interface change or halted for update.
- **Error Handling**: If adaptation fails repeatedly, escalate to system halt for affected operations.
- **Performance Note**: Detection and adaptation must add less than 5 seconds overhead.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Interface change detection pauses operation and logs issue.
  - // TEST: Successful adaptation resumes operation with updated workflow.
  - // TEST: Repeated adaptation failure escalates to operation halt.

## 4. Input Validation
- **MCP Tool Configuration**: Must specify valid tool name and dependencies.
- **Workflow Steps**: Must include target URL and actionable steps for web interaction.
- **TradeOrder Details**: Must be compatible with target web interface fields.

## 5. Integration Points
- Interfaces with Grekko's central logging for automation step tracking.
- Connects to TradingAgent for TradeOrder retrieval and status updates.
- Utilizes MCP tool resources for browser automation.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- MCPTool.IntegrationStatus reflecting tool readiness.
- TradeOrder.Status updates post-automation execution.
- Comprehensive logs of automation steps and errors for audit and debugging.
