# Pseudocode Design: Multi-Agent Coordination for Autonomous Trading

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the logical flow for implementing multi-agent coordination protocols in the Grekko autonomous trading system. The focus is on enabling multiple TradingAgents to communicate and reach consensus on trade decisions.

## 2. Module Purpose
- Facilitate communication between multiple TradingAgents.
- Ensure consensus on trade decisions to avoid conflicts.
- Log coordination events for audit and performance analysis.

## 3. Logical Flow

### 3.1 Initialize Agent Communication Channel
- **Preconditions**: Multiple TradingAgents active within the system.
- **Steps**:
  1. Establish a secure communication channel for agent interactions.
  2. Register each TradingAgent with a unique AgentID on the channel.
  3. Test channel connectivity with a simple message exchange.
  4. Set channel status to 'operational' on success or 'failed' on error.
- **Postconditions**: Communication channel ready for agent coordination.
- **Error Handling**: If channel setup fails, log error and fallback to isolated agent decisions.
- **Performance Note**: Channel initialization must complete within 1 second.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Communication channel established with registered AgentIDs.
  - // TEST: Successful test message exchange sets channel status to 'operational'.
  - // TEST: Setup failure logs error and triggers isolated decision fallback.

### 3.2 Propose Trade Decision for Consensus
- **Preconditions**: TradingAgent has a trade decision (TradeOrder proposal); channel operational.
- **Steps**:
  1. Format trade proposal with details (Asset, Quantity, Price, Type, Rationale).
  2. Broadcast proposal to all registered agents via communication channel.
  3. Record proposal timestamp and await responses within timeout period.
  4. Log proposal broadcast for audit purposes.
- **Postconditions**: Trade proposal shared with other agents for evaluation.
- **Error Handling**: If broadcast fails, log error and proceed with isolated decision if timeout reached.
- **Performance Note**: Proposal broadcast must complete within 200ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Trade proposal formatted and broadcast to all agents.
  - // TEST: Broadcast failure logs error and allows isolated decision post-timeout.
  - // TEST: Proposal timestamp and log recorded accurately.

### 3.3 Evaluate and Respond to Trade Proposals
- **Preconditions**: Trade proposal received from another agent.
- **Steps**:
  1. Validate received proposal against own market analysis and mode parameters.
  2. Determine agreement or disagreement based on RiskTolerance and strategy alignment.
  3. Send response (agree/disagree) with rationale back to proposing agent.
  4. Log evaluation result and response for audit.
- **Postconditions**: Response to proposal sent; evaluation logged.
- **Error Handling**: If validation or response fails, log error and default to disagreement.
- **Performance Note**: Evaluation and response must complete within 300ms.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Proposal validated against agent's market analysis and mode.
  - // TEST: Agreement/disagreement response sent with rationale.
  - // TEST: Validation failure defaults to disagreement with logged error.

### 3.4 Reach Consensus on Trade Decision
- **Preconditions**: Responses received from all agents or timeout reached for a proposal.
- **Steps**:
  1. Tally responses to determine majority agreement (e.g., 60% threshold for consensus).
  2. If consensus reached, finalize TradeOrder for execution.
  3. If no consensus, adjust proposal or defer decision based on mode priority.
  4. Notify all agents of final decision and log outcome.
- **Postconditions**: Trade decision finalized or deferred; agents notified.
- **Error Handling**: If tallying fails or responses incomplete, defer decision and log issue.
- **Performance Note**: Consensus process must complete within 500ms post-timeout.
- **TDD Anchors**:
  - // TEST: Majority agreement (60%) finalizes TradeOrder for execution.
  - // TEST: No consensus adjusts or defers proposal based on mode.
  - // TEST: Incomplete responses defer decision with logged issue.

## 4. Input Validation
- **AgentID**: Must be unique and registered on the communication channel.
- **Trade Proposal**: Must include all required fields (Asset, Quantity, Price, Type, Rationale).
- **Response**: Must indicate clear agreement or disagreement with supporting rationale.

## 5. Integration Points
- Interfaces with Grekko's `src/ai_adaptation/agent/autonomous_agent.py` for agent interactions.
- Connects to central logging for coordination event tracking.
- Utilizes communication channel for secure message exchange.

## 6. Expected Outputs
- Communication channel status reflecting operational readiness.
- TradeOrder decisions finalized or deferred based on consensus.
- Detailed logs of proposals, responses, and consensus outcomes for audit.
