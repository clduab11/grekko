Includes all required properties, methods, event handling, and TDD anchors for future testing.

This interface is the foundation for all wallet integrations (Coinbase, MetaMask, WalletConnect).

# --- TDD ANCHORS (Partial List, see spec for all 47) ---
# 1. Provider must initialize with correct identity properties
# 2. Provider must validate all input parameters
# 3. Provider must emit correct events on state changes
# 4. Provider must handle connection errors gracefully
# 5. Provider must support event-driven architecture
# 6. Provider must not leak credentials or secrets
# 7. Provider must validate all wallet addresses and transaction parameters
# 8. Provider must implement rate limiting for connection attempts (enforced by connection manager)
# 9. Provider must use environment variables for all configuration
# 10. Provider must support plugin-based extension

# (See registry and connection manager modules for additional TDD anchors)

# --- SECURITY & CONFIGURATION NOTES ---
# - All configuration must be loaded from environment variables (never hard-coded)
# - All user input must be validated and sanitized
# - All wallet operations must be logged via audit logger (see registry/manager)
# - No secrets or credentials may be stored in code
