"""
AtomicTransactionBuilder

Constructs multi-step atomic transactions for flash loan strategies.
Follows the pseudocode and TDD anchors from docs/phase3_flash_loan_strategies_pseudocode.md.

Integration:
- Used by FlashLoanStrategiesEngine for atomic execution
- Extends AI adaptation and event-driven patterns

Security:
- Validates all transaction steps and ensures atomicity
- Integrates slippage and MEV protection
